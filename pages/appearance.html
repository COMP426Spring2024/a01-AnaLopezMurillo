            <p>Unicorns are most notably described as having pure white fur and one horn on its forehead. This description originates from Ctesias' description he wrote while in Persia. Sources note that this description may have been inspired by the Indian rhinoceros, which was a single horned animal not known in Greece at the time.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The horn from the unicorn was known as an <span style="font-weight: bold;">alicorn</span>, and often given to nobles and kings as a present.</p>
