        <div class="block-text">
            <p>Unicorns are mythological creatures commonly associated with European and Medieval lore. These creatures, however, are not exclusive to European legend.</p>
            <br>
            <p>As early as 2000 BC, stories of unicorns originated in the Indus Valley Civilization during the Bronze Age. In Greek history, the unicorn is described as native to India, although it is not mentioned in Greek mythology itself.</p>
            <br>
            <p>During the Medieval Ages, the unicorn became a symbol of purity, lending itself to influence both secular and religious art.</p>

            <div class="block-text">
                <p>In European art and literature, the unicorn evolved to symbolize mythological purity and chastity.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Its horn was believed to be able to purify water and heal sicknesses. It was believed to be extremely difficult to tame, and made its home in the wilderness. Narwhal horns were often sold as unicorn horns, and concocted into various medicines.</p>
                <br>
                <p>During the Medieval and Rennaissance ages, it grew to encompass a symbol of fantasy, now associated in modern times with rainbows and fantasy stories.</p>
